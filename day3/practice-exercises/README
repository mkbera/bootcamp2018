Task 1
-----

Implement parallel max finding using pthreads.

Files:  

find_max_serial.c : A single threaded max finding implementation

To compile $makex

Execute:  $./serialmax 100000
                         |
                         |
                       #elements

A partial partial parallel implementation of the program using pthreads is given in 
find_max_parallel.c. The program should produce an executable similar to the executable 
file 'findmaxp'.

To run use the following command

$./findmaxp 1000000  4 
             |       |
             |       |
         #elements #threads    

Task 2
-----

A buggy parallel block hash implementation is given in blockhash.c.
You are required to fix the issues and generate correct block hashes.
